# UniDirectional_Ring_Leader_Election_in_O(n)_msgCplx

As Lynch and the crew proved, there is no way to elect a leader in a unidirectional ring under O(nlgn) message comlexity. But somehow this code works in O(n), either way I missed something in analyzing or it actually works.
Verification did not applied yet. (Time Complexity preserved.)
